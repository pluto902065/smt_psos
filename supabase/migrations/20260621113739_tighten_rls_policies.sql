/*
# Tighten RLS policies on all tables

## Summary
Replaces the previously unrestricted (always-true) INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
policies on master_orderers, master_models, master_hoses, and orders with
authenticated-only policies, fixing the "RLS Policy Always True" security
finding. Read access remains public (anon + authenticated) so the public
order-submission form and order-status view keep working without sign-in.

## Changes per table (master_orderers, master_models, master_hoses, orders)
- SELECT: unchanged — public read (anon, authenticated).
- INSERT: authenticated only.
- UPDATE: authenticated only.
- DELETE: authenticated only.

## Security
- All write operations now require an authenticated Supabase session.
- No data loss — only policies are dropped/recreated, not tables or data.
- Idempotent: each policy is dropped before recreate.
